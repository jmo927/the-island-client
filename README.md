# Welcome to The Island

**The Island** is a campaign for *Dungeons and Dragons* (5e) based on the hit series, *LOST*.  

This repo is the front-end of the project, including a blog detailing both the game-design process and the development of the project.  The repo containing the server info can be found [here](https://github.com/jmo927/the-island-server).

There are some *real* sketchy design choices in here that will be cleaned up in future updates.  We're on the honor system here, folks.  Please don't abuse things that weren't meant for you.
