    <h1>The Island Has Been Waiting For You</h1>
    <p>
      <em>The Island</em> is an attempt to write a Hex-Crawl for <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> (5e) that <del>doesn't suck</del> my players will enjoy, while also providing myself (and other Dungeon Masters) an updated way to run a campaign.
    </p>

    <p>
      For as much as I got into this hobby for the analog nature of the game, it can be easy to have upwards of 5 books open at the table as various points of reference, and there's only so much space behind the DM Screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once completed, a DM should be able to run <em>The Island</em> entirely from this page, with all of the adventure knowledge, lore, creature statistics, maps, and magic items easily available in one handy location.*
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The Island</em> is <em>heavily</em> inspired by the tv show <em>LOST</em> and the adventure module <a href="https://shop.swordfishislands.com/the-dark-of-hot-springs-island-digital/" target="_blank"><em>Hot Springs Island</em></a>.  All nods, references, and similarities are made with love.

      * Note: This module is entirely DM facing, meaning this will not provide maps, tokens, or other incidentals for the players to interact with.  <em>The Island</em> is assumed to be ran using "theater of the mind" style DMing, although how you run your table is none of my business.
